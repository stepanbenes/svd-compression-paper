* In my opinion the meaning of the first paragraph of section 3 in the given context is still unclear (or confusing) and needs (a small) correction. It seems to me that authors in the paragraph too generally, and the re-formulation of this paragraph can easily improve the quality of the paper. Let me explain that on the first several sentences (it is not my task to write the paper, that is what the authors should do):
    * "SVD is applied on matrices. The first thing to do is therefore to assemble an input matrix." - ok, but that is what we already know and no new information is given
	* "Results from the FEM are scalar, vector o tensor fields .... As an example ... can serve." - ok, that is what we also know, but how it is related to the first two sentences?
	* "There are two similar sets of results." - oh, what? how is it related to what was written before?
    * etc.

The original paragraph:

```SVD is applied on matrices. The first thing to do is therefore to assemble an input matrix. Results from the finite element method are scalar, vector or tensor fields represented by discrete values calculated in nodes of the mesh or in integration points on finite elements. As an example, temperature field, vector of nodal displacements, strain tensor evaluated in integration points, etc. can serve. There are two similar sets of results. One is generated by a non-linear algorithms, where several incremental steps are stored and the other is generated by time integration, where results in particular time steps are stored. In order to compress data, an auxiliary matrix $\mtrx{A}$ has to be assembled. The number of rows of the matrix $\mtrx{A}$ is equal to the number of incremental or time steps while the number of columns is equal to the number of points in which the results are stored. Such auxiliary matrix is assembled for each scalar field and for each component of the vector and tensor fields. It means, three matrices corresponding to the displacement in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions are assembled for the vector of displacements in three-dimensional problems.```

Some sentences were removed as they were too general, unnecessary, or confusing. The rest was reformulated to the following form:

```Results from the finite element method are scalar, vector or tensor fields represented by discrete values calculated in nodes of the mesh or in integration points on finite elements. In order to compress data, an auxiliary matrix $\mtrx{A}$ has to be assembled from the results. The number of rows of the matrix $\mtrx{A}$ is equal to the number of incremental or time steps while the number of columns is equal to the number of points in which the results are stored. Such auxiliary matrix is assembled for each scalar field and for each component of the vector and tensor fields. It means, three matrices corresponding to the displacement in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions are assembled for the vector of displacements in three-dimensional problems.```

* Line 155: performance of its the implementation. - delete "the"

The article was removed.

* Line 408: Also, the implementation on modern hardware environment. - the verb is missing

The missing verb was added and the sentence was reformulated as follows:

```Also, the modern hardware architectures use caches to optimize reading of consecutive memory blocks. ...```

* Line 425: For a matrix that is too large to t in fast memory, - something is missing

The lost letters were added:

```For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, ...```

* Line 538: Once the matrices A are -> Once the matrix A is

Corrected.

* Line 572: Once the SVD -> Once SVD

The article was removed.

* Line 649: delete "," in eq. (18)

The comma was removed.

* Line 684: xmax != xmin -> xmax > xmin

The condition was refined. `>` sign was substituted.

* Line 716: Storage size of the SVD -> Storage size of SVD; Line 1251: use of the SVD -> use of SVD

The articles were removed in those sentences as well as in few other cases where the article was used inproperly in connection with SVD.

* Figure 13: in other graphs x axis is in increasing order for both - rank and compression ratio

The direction of horizontal axis was reversed in Figure 13.
