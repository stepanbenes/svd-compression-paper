Reviewer 1

In my opinion the meaning of the first paragraph of section 3 in the given context is still unclear (or confusing) and needs (a small) correction. It seems to me that authors in the paragraph too generally, and the re-formulation of this paragraph can easily improve the quality of the paper.
	 
Let me explain that on the first several sentences (it is not my task to write the paper, that is what the authors should do):
- "SVD is applied on matrices. The first thing to do is therefore to assemble an input matrix." - ok, but that is what we already know and no new information is given
- "Results from the FEM are scalar, vector o tensor fields .... As an example ... can serve." - ok, that is what we also know, but how it is related to the first two sentences?
- "There are two similar sets of results."  - oh, what? how is it related to what was written before?
- etc.

- Line 155: performance of its the implementation. - delete "the"
- Line 408: Also, the implementation on modern hardware environment. - the verb is missing
- Line 425: For a matrix that is too large to t in fast memory, - something is missing
- Line 538: Once the matrices A are -> Once the matrix A is
- Line 572: Once the SVD -> Once SVD
- Line 649: delete "," in eq. (18)
- Line 684: xmax != xmin -> xmax > xmin
- Line 716: Storage size of the SVD -> Storage size of SVD
- Line 1251: use of the SVD -> use of SVD
- Figure 13: in other graphs x axis is in increasing order for both - rank and compression ratio
