\begin{abstract}
%% Text of abstract should have three parts: Motivation. This paper. Summary.
Amount of data produced by complex finite element analysis can be enormous and typical personal computer is not capable to store, process and visualize the results in reasonable time. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is well known factorization method that provides rich information about matrix systems. One of its many applications is image compression where it can significantly reduce size of data representing image while preserving quality of image appearance.
\newline
This paper describes application of SVD to the compression of results from finite element solvers. Although the idea of image compression method is inspiration for this research work, the SVD compression algorithm used for compression of images can not be directly used upon FEM results. Differences and implementation challenges are discussed in the text. Quality of approximation is more important in scientific field then in computer graphics where the main deciding factor is the human perception of the resulting image. Error estimation methods used during compression of finite element results are presented in the text. The focus is also on the algorithm performance. SVD is very computational intensive method. Various optimization techniques, e.g. Randomized SVD, are described in the text.
\newline
The results of the method are presented on various finite element analyses. The method allows to control quality of compression. The compression factor depends on the nature of data input. However, for common cases that were investigated the method achieves to lower the memory consumption up to 10\% of the original size with negligible approximation error.
